I wish you the best of luck, and a lifetime of happiness with your soon-to-be wife! Have an amazing new life, and don't forget us! :)</p>

They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
