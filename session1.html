  			<p>Thank you Salmon for all the lengdary things you've done for us! You're by far one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. All those amazing and hilarious times with you teaching us ruby on rails is easily the best part of my IX experience! I wish you could have stayed for longer. I wish you the best of luck, and a lifetime of happiness with your soon-to-be wife! Have an amazing new life, and don't forget us! :)
