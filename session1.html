                <p>Thank you Salmon for all the lengdary things you've done for us! You're by far one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. All those amazing and hilarious times with you teaching us ruby on rails is easily the best part of my IX experience! I wish you could have stayed for longer. I wish you the best of luck, and a lifetime of happiness with your soon-to-be wife! Have an amazing new life, and don't forget us! :)</p>

                <p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone.</p>

Oh dear...The odds of successfully surviving an attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer are approximately... Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
