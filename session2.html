                <p>Salman, it has been incredible learning under your instruction, as not only a student but also a friend and fellow fast-breaker. I know that thanks to you, I'm a more cultured person today, walking away enlightened in bhangra, All Your Base, internet cat memes, and other debauchery. I hope we might someday cross paths again and carry on with drinking tea and discussing existence. All the best!</p>

You were so understanding and supportive, and it really meant a lot that you listened, even to the things I wasn't saying. You have a great way with people, and that's why they gravitate towards you. Wishing you the very best at your wedding, and I hope to cross paths with you again soon :) </p>

Oh dear...The odds of successfully surviving an attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer are approximately... Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is. If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
